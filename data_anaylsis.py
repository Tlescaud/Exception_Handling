# data analysis using python!!!!!!!!

# Sure! Imagine you have a big box of LEGO bricks in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors. You want to build something cool,
#
# but first, you need to figure out what bricks you have and how many of each kind.
#
# Data Analysis with LEGO Bricks
# Collecting Data:
#
# First, you dump all the LEGO bricks out of the box and onto the floor. Now, you have all the data (bricks) you need!
#
# Sorting and Counting:
#
# Next, you sort the bricks by color and shape. You put all the red bricks in one pile, all the blue bricks in another,
#
# and so on. Then, you count how many bricks are in each pile. This helps you understand what you have.
#
# Finding Patterns:
#
# You notice that you have more red bricks than blue ones, or you have a lot of small bricks but only a few big ones.
#
# These patterns help you decide what you can build.
#
# Making Decisions:
#
# Based on the patterns you found, you decide to build a big red castle because you have lots of red bricks.
# Or maybe youâ€™ll build a small car because you have enough small bricks and wheels.
#
# Building Something Cool:
#
# Finally, you use the information you gathered to start building your LEGO creation.
# You put the bricks together in a way that makes sense based on what you have.
